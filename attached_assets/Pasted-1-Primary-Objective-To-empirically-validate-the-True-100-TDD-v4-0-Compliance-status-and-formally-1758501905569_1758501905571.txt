1. Primary Objective
To empirically validate the "True 100% TDD v4.0 Compliance" status and formally conclude Phase 2. This prompt will create the final database performance indexes and execute a definitive, all-encompassing validation suite that proves every requirement from the Phase 2 TDD has been successfully implemented.

2. Step 1: Finalize Database Performance
Before the final tests, we will create the performance-optimizing indexes required by the TDD to ensure the database can handle production load efficiently.
Execute in the Shell:
Bash
# Generate the final migration script for performance indexes
poetry run alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Add final performance indexes for Phase 2"

# Apply the migration to the database
poetry run alembic upgrade head
3. Step 2: Implement the Final TDD Validation Suite
This is the ultimate validation. Create a new, single test file tests/test_phase2_final_validation.py that covers every critical aspect of the Phase 2 TDD acceptance criteria.

4. Step 3: Execute Final Validation
This final command executes the comprehensive test suite. A 100% pass rate will serve as the official sign-off for Phase 2, confirming that the platform is secure, fully functional, and compliant with the TDD.
Execute in the Shell:
Bash
poetry run pytest tests/test_phase2_final_validation.py -v
Upon successful completion of this test run, Phase 2 is officially complete. The platform is ready for the handoff to the frontend team for
